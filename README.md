# Portfolio (static)

This is a simple, responsive static portfolio template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to use

1. Customize `index.html` with your name, bio, and project details.
2. Edit `css/style.css` to change colors, spacing, and layout.
3. Edit `js/main.js` to change interactions (theme toggle, contact behavior).

Quick preview (from repository root):

```bash
cd /home/hasibcucse/Desktop/aicv/portfolio
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes

- The contact form is a demo and does not send emails â€” integrate your backend or a service like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a server endpoint to accept messages.
- Replace placeholder project cards and images with your real work.
 - Place a profile photo at `assets/photo.jpg` (or edit the `img` src in `index.html`).
